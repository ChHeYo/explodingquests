It's a job board/service board that lists out 'quests' that people can undertake.
Every job board has a timer that, upon expiration, explodes the quest.
The site's look and feel should simulate quests in games.

People would be referred as NPC.

I would need to:

    1. list of quests (listview) and detailviews of each quest
        a. fields = (title, objectives, rewards, npc_id, image(option), timer, slug)
    2. geolocation plugin so that when people login,
       they can see quests posted by people living nearby.
    3. login and logout
    4. registration
	a. Use registration-redux to take care of this task (email activation)
    5. filter (new, hot, random, etc)
    6. about, contact us, terms of agreement
